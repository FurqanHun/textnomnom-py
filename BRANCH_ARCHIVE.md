This branch (`v1-archive`) has been created from the `master` branch to preserve the original v1.0 codebase of TextNomNom.

### Creation Details
- **Source Branch**: `master` 
- **Source Commit**: `a8290c8` - feat: ocr-mix, clear-log
- **Purpose**: Archive the original v1.0 implementation before merging v2.0 modularized version
- **Created**: As part of preserving the original code structure

### v1.0 Codebase Structure
The archived v1.0 implementation consists of:
- Single `main.py` file (~414 lines)
- Monolithic structure with all functionality in one file

This archive allows maintaining a reference to the original code structure while moving forward with the v2.0 modularized implementation on the master branch.
